# 27. Active learning

Supervised deep learning techniques typically require a huge number of annotated/labelled examples to provide a training dataset. However labelling at scale take significant time, expertise and resources. Active learning techniques aim to reduce the total amount of annotation that needs to be performed by selecting the most useful images to label from a large pool of unlabelled images, thus reducing the time to generate useful training datasets. These processes may be referred to as [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://medium.com/pytorch/https-medium-com-robert-munro-active-learning-with-pytorch-2f3ee8ebec)
