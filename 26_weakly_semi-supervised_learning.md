# 26. Weakly & semi-supervised learning

Weakly & semi-supervised learning are two methods of machine learning that use both labeled and unlabeled data for training. Weakly supervised learning uses weakly labeled data, which may be incomplete or inaccurate, while semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data. Weakly supervised learning is typically used in situations where labeled data is scarce and unlabeled data is abundant. Semi-supervised learning is typically used in situations where labeled data is abundant but also contains some noise or errors. Both techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models by making use of additional data sources.
