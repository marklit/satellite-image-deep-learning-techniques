# 33. Thermal Infrared

Thermal infrared remote sensing is a technique used to detect and measure thermal radiation emitted from the Earthâ€™s surface. This technique can be used to measure the temperature of the ground and any objects on it and can detect the presence of different materials. Thermal infrared remote sensing is used to assess land cover, detect land-use changes, and monitor urban heat islands, as well as to measure the temperature of the ground during nighttime or in areas of limited visibility.
