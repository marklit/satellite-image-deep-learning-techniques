The analysis of time series observations in remote sensing data has numerous applications, including enhancing the accuracy of classification models and forecasting future patterns and events. [Image source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/23/4822). Note: since classifying crops and predicting crop yield are such prominent use case for time series data, these tasks have dedicated sections after this one.
