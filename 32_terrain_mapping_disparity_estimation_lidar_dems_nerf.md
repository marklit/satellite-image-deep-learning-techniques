# 32. Terrain mapping, Disparity Estimation, Lidar, DEMs & NeRF

Measure surface contours & locate 3D points in space from 2D images. NeRF stands for Neural Radiance Fields and is the term used in deep learning communities to describe a model that generates views of complex 3D scenes based on a partial set of 2D images
