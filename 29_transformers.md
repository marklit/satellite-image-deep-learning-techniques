# 29. Transformers

Vision transformers are state-of-the-art models for vision tasks such as image classification and object detection. They differ from CNNs as they use self-attention instead of convolution to learn global relations between all pixels in the image. Vision transformers employ a transformer encoder architecture, composed of multi-layer blocks with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers, enabling the capture of rich contextual information for more accurate predictions.
