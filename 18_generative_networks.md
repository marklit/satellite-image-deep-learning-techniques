  <b>Example generated images using a GAN.</b>

Generative networks (e.g. GANs) aim to generate new, synthetic data that appears similar to real-world data. This generated data can be used for a wide range of purposes, including data augmentation, data imbalance correction, and filling in missing or corrupted data. Including generating synthetic data can improve the performance of remote sensing algorithms and models, leading to more accurate and reliable results.
