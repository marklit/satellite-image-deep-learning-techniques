Crop yield is a crucial metric in agriculture, as it determines the productivity and profitability of a farm. It is defined as the amount of crops produced per unit area of land and is influenced by a range of factors including soil fertility, weather conditions, the type of crop grown, and pest and disease control. By utilizing time series of satellite images, it is possible to perform accurate crop type classification and take advantage of the seasonal variations specific to certain crops. This information can be used to optimize crop management practices and ultimately improve crop yield. However, to achieve accurate results, it is essential to consider the quality and resolution of the input data, as well as the availability of labeled training data. Appropriate pre-processing and feature extraction techniques must also be employed. [Image source](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/17/4193).
