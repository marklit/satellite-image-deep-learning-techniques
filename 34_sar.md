# 34. SAR

SAR (synthetic aperture radar) is used to detect and measure the properties of objects and surfaces on the Earth's surface. SAR can be used to detect changes in terrain, features, and objects over time, as well as to measure the size, shape, and composition of objects and surfaces. SAR can also be used to measure moisture levels in soil and vegetation, or to detect and monitor changes in land use.
