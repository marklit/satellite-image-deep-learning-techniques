Crop classification in remote sensing is the identification and mapping of different crops in images or sequences of images. It aims to provide insight into the distribution and composition of crops in a specific area, with applications that include monitoring crop growth and evaluating crop damage. Both traditional machine learning methods, such as decision trees and support vector machines, and deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to perform crop classification. The optimal method depends on the size and complexity of the dataset, the desired accuracy, and the available computational resources. However, the success of crop classification relies heavily on the quality and resolution of the input data, as well as the availability of labeled training data.
